# SmartGas-ESP32-Servo
Project for the IoT course that uses an ESP32 with an Servo motor, RGB LED and MQTT protocol

## Project Overview

The project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with a Servo motor that is activated by MQTT protocol messages published by the [SmartGas-ESP32-MQ2](https://github.com/victor013001/SmartGas-ESP32-MQ2) project. Additionally, it incorporates an RGB LED for visual alerts and publishes messages regarding the Servo status.
